In this workbook, we'll explore more of how we can use Python to automate and speed up analysis. In addition, we'll look at using basic visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="Motivating-Question"><span style="color:green">Motivating Question</span><a class="anchor-link" href="#Motivating-Question"> </a></h2><p>So far, we've only looked at data from 2015. However, part of what makes the LODES data so useful is the availability of the data over many years. The data are available in multiple CSV files. There are many insights we might find from analyzing data over years, so we want to be able to bring them all together. In this notebook, we'll explore how to do that as we try to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference in the number of jobs by age group and by year? What are the different trends across years?</strong></p>
<p>To answer these, we'll introduce you to creating Python functions to make reading datasets easier. Then, we'll use them within loops to automate reading in datasets. Finally, we'll show some basic visualizations with the data that we get to bring it all together.</p>

<p>Matplotlib is the new library here, giving us access to visualization tools that we'll use in the second half of this notebook. In addition, notice that we've included a line with <code>%matplotlib inline</code>. This is something called a <strong>magic function</strong>, and this magic function allows us to see plots "inline," or within the text of the Jupyter notebook. Don't worry too much about how it works -- just make sure to include it whenever you want to plot in Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<h2 id="Looking-at-Multiple-Years">Looking at Multiple Years<a class="anchor-link" href="#Looking-at-Multiple-Years"> </a></h2><p>In the previous workbook, we looked at the 2015 dataset. We might want to look at multiple years to see what happens across years and the difference in industries by year. However, it can get quite tedious if we want to bring in the different csv files one by one. To speed up the whole process, we can use Python to automate the process of bringing in datasets and make the whole task much easier to manage.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we'll go over how to automate the downloading of the LODES files by creating functions and for loops. To set everything up, refer to page 2 in the LODES data documentation (you can access it <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/LODESTechDoc7.3.pdf">here</a>). This describes the directory tree as well as explaining that the CSV files are compressed using a GZip algorithm. You don't need to worry too much about the details here, but we use this information in determining how exactly we'll automate the downloading process.</p>
