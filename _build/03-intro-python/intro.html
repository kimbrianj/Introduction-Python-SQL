<p>In these workbooks, we will start with a motivating question, then walk through the process we need to go through in order to answer the motivating question. Along the way, we will walk through various Python commands and develop skills as we work towards answering the question.</p>
<p>As you work, there will be headers that are in <strong><span style="color:green">GREEN</span></strong>. These indicate locations where there is an accompanying video. This video may walk through the steps or expand on the topics discussed in that section. Though it isn't absolutely necessary to watch the video while working through this notebook, we highly recommend watching them at least once on your first time through.</p>
<p><strong><span style = "color:green">If you have not yet watched the "Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks" video, watch it before you proceed!</span></strong></p>
<p>You will also run into some headers that are in <strong><span style="color:red">RED</span></strong>. These headers indicate a checkpoint to practice writing the code yourself. You should stop at these checkpoints and try doing the exercises and answering the questions posed in these sections.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: When you open a notebook, make sure you run each cell containing code from the beginning. Since the code we're writing builds on everything written before, if you don't make sure to run everything from the beginning, some things may not work.</strong></p>
<p>In each of the workbooks, we will start out with a motivating question. Here, we'll introduce the data that we'll work with, which will lead into our motivating question for this workbook.</p>

<h2 id="Longitudinal-Employer-Household-Dynamics-(LEHD)-Data">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Longitudinal-Employer-Household-Dynamics-(LEHD)-Data"> </a></h2><p>In these workbooks, we will be using LEHD data. These are public-use data sets containing information about employers and employees. Information about the LEHD Data can be found at <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/">https://lehd.ces.census.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>We will be using the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) datasets in our applications in this workbook. Each state has three main types of files: Origin-Destination data, in which job totals are associated with a home and work Census block pair, Residence Area Characteristic data, in which job totals are by home Census block, and Workplace Area Characteristic data, in which job totals are by workplace Census block. In addition to these three, there is a "geographic crosswalk" file with descriptions of the Census Blocks as they appear the in the LODES datasets.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the LODES datasets <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES7/LODESTechDoc7.3.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Motivating-Question-(VIDEO)"><span style="color:green">Motivating Question (VIDEO)</span><a class="anchor-link" href="#Motivating-Question-(VIDEO)"> </a></h2><p>The dataset we'll be working with in this workbook is the Workplace Area Characteristics data, which aggregates job totals by workplace census block. We want to explore this dataset and get a better idea of the distribution of jobs. That is, we want to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>How can we characterize the number of jobs in the state? What can we say about the distribution of the number of jobs by census block? What are distributions of jobs by different categories, such as age group or industry?</strong></p>
<p>As you work through this notebook, we'll work towards answering these questions, so try to keep in mind what we're working toward.</p>

<h2 id="Starting-Out:-Introduction-to-Python">Starting Out: Introduction to Python<a class="anchor-link" href="#Starting-Out:-Introduction-to-Python"> </a></h2><p>In order to try to answer these questions, we'll write code to bring in datasets, manipulate these datasets, and summarize datasets using Python. Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that has seen a rise in use for data analysis. As of 2017, Python is near or at the top in terms of popularity in programming languages for data analysis (see <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/05/poll-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-software-leaders.html">the kdnuggets post</a> or <a href="http://makemeanalyst.com/most-popular-languages-for-data-science-and-analytics-2017/">a look at multiple surveys</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, unlike other tools for statistical analysis, like Excel or Stata, Python is designed to be general-purpose. This means that we aren't limited to only doing certain statistical analyses and gives us much more flexibility in what we can do.</p>
