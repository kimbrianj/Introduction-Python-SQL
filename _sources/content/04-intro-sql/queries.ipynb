    "You should see 10 rows of the `ca_wac_2015` dataset. Let's go over the basics of this SQL command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT:** We start out with the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement specifies which variables (columns) you want. \n",
    "    - Here, we used `SELECT *`. The \"`*`\" just says that we want all the variables. \n",
    "    - If we wanted a few columns, we would use the column names separated by commas instead of \"`*`\" (for example, `w_geocode, createdate`).\n",
    "\n",

    "- **FROM:** Now, let's look at the next part of the query, `FROM ca_wac_2015`. This part of the query specifies the table, `ca_wac_2015`, from which we want to retrieve the data. Most of your queries will begin in this fashion, describing which columns you want and from which table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LIMIT:** We typically include a `LIMIT` statement at the end of our query so that we don't get overloaded with rows being output. Here, `LIMIT 10` means that we just want the first ten rows. Many times, the `LIMIT` that you want will be higher than 10 -- you might generally prefer to use 1000 or so. Having a `LIMIT` for all queries is highly recommended even if you know only a few rows will be shown, since it acts as a safety precaution against (for example) displaying millions of rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we've put everything in one line, but that's not necessary. We could have split the code up into multiple lines, like so:\n",

    "    FROM ca_wac_2015\n",
    "    LIMIT 10;\n",

    "\n",
    "Along those lines, note that we used a semi-colon at the end of the query to mark the end of the query. That isn't absolutely necessary here, but it does help mark the end of a query and is required in other applications of SQL, so it's good practice to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Side note about capitalization\n",
    "If you notice, we've been using all caps for SQL commands and all lowercase for data table and schema names. This is simply a convention, as SQL is not case sensitive. For example, we could have run `select * from ca_wac_2015 limit 10;` and it would have given us the exact same output as the first query. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This does mean you need to be careful when using column names. If your column name has capital letters in it, you need use double quotes (e.g. `\"C000\"`) to preserve the capitalization. For this reason, you might find that using all lowercase letters in column names is preferable, which is what we've done here.\n",

    "    LIMIT 100;\n",
    "\n",
    "We've changed the original query by using `w_geocode, createdate` instead of `*`, so we'll only get the values from two columns, `w_geocode` and `createdate`. In addition, we've changed the value after `LIMIT` to be 100 instead of 10, so we'll get the first 100 rows instead of the first 10 rows."
