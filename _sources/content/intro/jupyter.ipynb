    "You can access all of the content within this book as executable files called **Jupyter notebooks**. These Jupyter notebooks can be opened through the cloud using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or Binder, which serves the notebooks in a temporary space. If you would like to try running the notebooks locally on your own computer, you can also download the notebooks and download Jupyter to run them. The easiest way is likely by using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go over the structure of how to navigate and use a Jupyter notebook, as well as provide a short introduction to some concepts in Python. This section is written assuming you have already opened it using Colab or Binder (or downloaded it). You can still look through it without doing the interactive parts, but some of the descriptions of the Jupyter environment won't make sense. "
