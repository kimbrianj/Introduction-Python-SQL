In this notebook, we'll explore how to do that as we try to answer the following questions:\n",

This describes the directory tree as well as explaining that the CSV files are compressed using a GZip algorithm. You don't need to worry too much about the details here, but we use this information in determining how exactly we'll automate the downloading process."
