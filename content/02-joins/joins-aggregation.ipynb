    "Suppose we wanted to know the distribution of the total number of jobs in California by county. The employment information is in one table, and county information is in another table. We need to join them, then aggregate the jobs, by county. Even though this seems like a complicated multi-step process, we can actually do it all in one query.  Let's break it down into two parts: the join and the aggregation.\n",
