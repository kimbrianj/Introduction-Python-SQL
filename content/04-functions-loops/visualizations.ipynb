    "### Making a Histogram\n",
    "We'll start with a basic histogram. A histogram is useful for looking at the distribution of a numerical variable (that is, a variable that takes numbers as its values as opposed to categories). They can visually represent the spread and center of the variable, as well as provide insights to the shape of the distribution. For example, we can look at the number of **modes**, or peaks, in the data, which wouldn't be captured in numerical summaries such as mean or variance. We can also get a better idea of the **skew** of the data, determining whether most units are grouped on the left or right side (lower or higher values), or whether it's mostly symmetrical. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first look at the simplest way to make a graph, then show how to customize it using the plotting parameters as well as Figure and Axes objects. Let's look at a histogram of the total jobs in the 2015 Workplace Area Characteristics for California."

    "\n",
    "Now this histogram is quite unhelpful. It's very hard to see, but it's probably because there is an outlier that is forcing the boxplot into this scaling, and giving us a very limited view of the data because almost every observation is in one bar. We can fix these using some additional parameters."

Instead of putting everything into bins, though, a boxplot plots the median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile, along with outer limits and outliers. This makes for a simpler graph, and can be especially useful for comparing the distribution of multiple groups. However, unlike with histograms, you don't get any information about the number of modes.\n",
