    "We can store data in many different ways within Python. We've gone over one way to do this using Data Frames, which have nice rows and columns in a rectangular format like we might be used to seeing data. However, there are other types of objects that might be better for different types of data. In this section, we will look at different types of objects within Python that will help us better manage the data."

    "A **dictionary** is like a list, except it doesn't have an order in which **values** (which can be any Python object) are stored, and you access the elements of a dictionary using a **key**. Think of a dictionary like a bag of objects, from which we can find the object we want by using the appropriate label. In our case, we'll create a dictionary that has the year as the key and the Data Frame for that year as the value. This give us an easy way of both storing and accessing the Data Frames that we want to get. \n",
