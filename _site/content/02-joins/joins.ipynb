    "One of the nice things about relational databases is organization using multiple tables that are linked together in some way. For example, suppose we have one table with 6 rows called **Table A**:\n",

    "|---|---|\n",
    "|1|5|\n",

    "Let's say we want to combine Table A and Table B so that we have one table that contains information about `blockid`, `C000`, and `CA01`. We want to do this by matching the two tables by what they have in common, `blockid`. That is, we want a table that looks like this (let's call this **Table C**):\n",

    "\n",
    "Table C has each `blockid` that was in both Table A and Table B. It also contains the appropriate values for `C000` and `CA01` corresponding to each `blockid`. This kind of matching can be quite tricky to figure out manually, since there are different numbers of rows in each table, not all of the `blockid` values match for the two tables, and there are some `blockid` values that aren't in both. Fortunately for us, SQL is well-equipped to handle this task using the `JOIN` statement."
